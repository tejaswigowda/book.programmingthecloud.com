## mdBook 0.3.2
[9cd47eb...2b649fe](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/compare/9cd47eb...2b649fe)

### Added
- Added a markdown renderer, which is off by default. This may be useful for
  debugging preprocessors.
  [#1018](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/1018)
- Code samples may now include line numbers with the
  `output.html.playpen.line-numbers` configuration value.
  [#1035](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/1035)
- The `watch` and `serve` commands will now ignore files listed in
  `.gitignore`.
  [#1044](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/1044)
- Added automatic dark-theme detection based on the CSS `prefers-color-scheme`
  feature. This may be enabled by setting `output.html.preferred-dark-theme`
  to your preferred dark theme.
  [#1037](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/1037)
- Added `rustdoc_include` preprocessor. This makes it easier to include
  portions of an external Rust source file. The rest of the file is hidden,
  but the user may expand it to see the entire file, and will continue to work
  with `mdbook test`.
  [#1003](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/1003)
- Added Ctrl-Enter shortcut to the playpen editor to automatically run the
  sample.
  [#1066](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/1066)
- Added `output.html.playpen.copyable` configuration option to disable
  the copy button.
  [#1050](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/1050)
- Added ability to dynamically expand and fold sections within the sidebar.
  See the `output.html.fold` configuration to enable this feature.
  [#1027](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/1027)

### Changed
- Use standard `scrollbar-color` CSS along with webkit extension
  [#816](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/816)
- The renderer build directory is no longer deleted before the renderer is
  run. This allows a backend to cache results between runs.
  [#985](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/985)
- Next/prev links now highlight on hover to indicate it is clickable.
  [#994](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/994)

- Errors in `[output.html]` config are no longer ignored.
  [#1033](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/1033)
- Updated highlight.js for syntax highlighting updates (primarily to add
  async/await to Rust highlighting).
  [#1041](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/1041)
- Raised minimum supported rust version to 1.35.
  [#1003](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/1003)
- Hidden code lines are no longer dynamically removed via JavaScript, but
  instead managed with CSS.
  [#846](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/846)
  [#1065](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/1065)
- Changed the default font set for the ACE editor, giving preference to
  "Source Code Pro".
  [#1062](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/1062)

- Fixed error message when running `clean` multiple times.
  [#1055](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/1055)

  [#1005](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/1005)
- Stop using `inline-block` for `inline code`, fixing selection highlighting
  and some rendering issues.
  [#1058](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/1058)
- Fix header auto-hide on browsers with momentum scrolling that allows
  negative `scrollTop`.
  [#1070](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/1070)

## mdBook 0.2.3 (2018-01-18)
[2c20c99...6cbc41d](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/compare/2c20c99...6cbc41d)

### Added

  [#866](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/866)

## mdBook 0.2.2 (2018-10-19)
[7e2e095...2c20c99](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/compare/7e2e095...2c20c99)

### Added
- ðŸŽ‰ Process-based custom preprocessors. See [the
  docs](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/for_developers/preprocessors.html)
  for more.
  [#792](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/792)

- ðŸŽ‰ Configurable preprocessors.

  Added `build.use-default-preprocessors` boolean TOML key to allow disabling
  the built-in `links` and `index` preprocessors.

  Added `[preprocessor]` TOML tables to configure each preprocessor.

  Specifying `[preprocessor.links]` or `[preprocessor.index]` will enable the
  respective built-in preprocessor if `build.use-default-preprocessors` is
  `false`.

  Added `fn supports_renderer(&self, renderer: &str) -> bool` to the
  `Preprocessor` trait to specify if the preprocessor supports the given
  renderer. The default implementation always returns `true`.

  `Preprocessor::run` now takes a book by value instead of a mutable
  reference. It should return a `Book` value with the intended modifications.

  Added `PreprocessorContext::renderer` to indicate the renderer being used.

  [#658](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/658)
  [#787](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/787)

  [#777](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/777)
- Ensure section numbers are correctly incremented after a horizontal
  separator
  [#790](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/790)

## mdBook 0.2.1 (2018-08-22)
[91ffca1...7e2e095](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/compare/91ffca1...7e2e095)

### Changed
- Update to handlebars-rs 1.0
  [#761](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/761)

### Fixed
- Fix table colors, broken by Stylus -> CSS transition
  [#765](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/765)

## mdBook 0.2.0 (2018-08-02)

### Changed
- ðŸ’¥ This release changes how links are handled in mdBook. Previously, relative
  links were interpreted relative to the book's root. In `0.2.0`+ links are
  relative to the page they are in, and use the `.md` extension. This has [several
  advantages](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/603#issue-166701447),
  such as making links work in other markdown viewers like GitHub. You will
  likely have to change links in your book to accommodate this change. For
  example, a book with this layout:

  ```
  chapter_1/
      section_1.md
      section_2.md
  SUMMARY.md
  ```

  Previously a link in `section_1.md` to `section_2.md` would look like this:
  ```markdown
  [section_2](chapter_1/section_2.html)
  ```

  Now it must be changed to this:
  ```markdown
  [section_2](section_2.md)
  ```

- ðŸ’¥ `mdbook test --library-path` now accepts a comma-delimited list of
  arguments rather than taking all following arguments. This makes it easier
  to handle the trailing book directory argument without always needing to put
  ` -- ` before it. Multiple instances of the option continue to be accepted:
  `mdbook test -L foo -L bar`.

- ðŸ’¥ `mdbook serve` has some of its options renamed for clarity. See `mdbook
  help serve` for details.

- Embedded rust playpens now use the "stable" playground API.
  [#754](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/754)

### Fixed
- Escaped includes (`\{{#include file.rs}}`) will now render correctly.
  [f30ce01](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/commit/f30ce0184d71e342141145472bf816419d30a2c5)
- `index.html` will now render correctly when the book's first section is
  inside a subdirectory.
  [#756](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/756)
