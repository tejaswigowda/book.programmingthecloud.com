# Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)

CSS provides a way to style HTML tags. CSS was developed to make html
'clean' that is to separate styles from tags. Thre are 3 important
concepts in CSS:

1. Properties
2. Values
3. Selectors


The easiest way to add CSS to an html tag is via the `style` attribute.

```html
<TAG_NAME style='prop1:val1; prop2:val2; prop3:val3'>

      content

</TAG_NAME>

```

CSS properties and values are writte in pairs seperated by colon (`:`).
These pairs are themselves delimitted by semi-colons(`;`);

The attribute value of `style` is known as *CSS declaration*.
