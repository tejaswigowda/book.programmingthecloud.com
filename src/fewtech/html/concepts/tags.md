# Tags

Tags are used to <b> mark up </b> content; this is where "markup
language" in HTML's acronym comes from. HTML is ust one of the many
markup languages, and definitely the most popular one. In recent years a
new open standard for HTML is being created. This is called HTML5.
Everything discussed in here is current with this latest version of
HTML. 

A HTML tag has 3 parts
1. Start of Tag, writen with the tag name within angle brackets
2. Content -- any valid html
3. End of Tag -- Similar to start but the tag name has a forward slash
   (/) prefix.

```html
<TAG_NAME>

      content

</TAG_NAME>
```
