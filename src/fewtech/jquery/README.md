jQuery is knoiwn as the syntactic-sugar for JavaScript. This means you
can write valid JavaScript without having to learn the full syntax of
JavaScript. jQuery is a JS library and hence all jQuery written is JS,
but not the other way around.

network or via downloading and linking the jQuery JS file.

```
