# JS Data Types

JavaScript variables are **loosely typed**, that is the data type of a
variable can be changed at anytime. This is an important distinction
from other *strongly typed* languages such as C, C++ and Java.

## `var` Keyword

Since Js is loosely typed there is only one variable declaration type --
using the `var` keyword.

## `typeof` operator
Even though there is only one type of variable declaration, Js does have
different dtat types. Loose typing allows for the same variable (think
of it as a container for values) to be reassigned to diffent data types.
The `typeof` operator allows us to inspect the datatype contained in a
variable.

```js
var x;
typeof x; // undefined
x = 1;
typeof x; // number
x = "a string";
typeof x; // string
```


## Numbers

## String

## Arrays
