# Objects

Objects are built in data type. An Object is a collection of
**properties** and **methods**. We have already looked at 2 built in
objects -- Strings and Arrays. They both have property `length` and many
different methods. 

Object property and methods can be accessed via the dot (`.`) operator
or through box brackets (`[]`). For example the string property `length`
can be accessed as follows:

```js
var s = "a test string";
var len = s.length; // using dot operator
var len = s["length"]; // using box brackets
```

Similarly any methoids (say `indexOf()`) can be accessed similarly:

```js
var s = "a test string";
var pos = s.indexOf(a); // using dot operator
var pos = s["indexOf"](a); // using box brackets
```


## Built In Objects

In this section we look at more built in objects.

### `date`
The `date` object provides an easy way to store and manipulate dates in
JS.


### `window`

### `document` -- Document Object Model (DOM)


# Functions
