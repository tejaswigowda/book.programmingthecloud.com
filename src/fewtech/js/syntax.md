# JS Syntax
A JS *program* is a list of JS statements. Each statement is interpreted
on the console one at a time.

A Javascript program is read top-to-bottom, left-to-right. This is known
as the **execution sequence**. Programming involves manipulating the
executuin sequnce in order to achive specific computational tasks.

## Statements
JS statements are made up of:

1. **Keywords**: Keywords are special words that provide commands to the
   interpreter. Keywords cannot be overloaded (i.e. used as variable
names).

The following is the list of all JS keywords:
```html
break, case, catch, continue, debugger, default,
delete, do, else, finally, for, function, if,
in, instanceof, new, return, switch, this, throw, 
try, typeof, var, void, while, with
```

This is not a complete list as JS continues to evolve and new keywords can be added.


2. **Values**: Values can either be fixed or variable. Fixed values are
   called *literals* and variable values are called *variables*.

 Example of literals include constants like `1`, `100`, `3.142` etc.

Variables are subject to the variable lifecycle that includes (in that
order) -- *declaration*, *definition* and *usage*.

A variable is declared in a JS statement by using the `var` keyword.
3. Operators
4. Expressions
5. Comments

Each statement is delimeted from another by either a semicolon (`;`) or
a newline.
