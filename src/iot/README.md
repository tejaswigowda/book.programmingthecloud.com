# What is IoT?

Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging field that focusses on
connecting everyday objects to the Internet. *What does it mean to
connect everyday objects to the Internet?* It means to implement clients
and servers on low-power, low-cost, small computers (known as
*microcontrollers*) to control everyday
objects. This section will teach you the basics of programming
clients/servers on ESP32, a production ready IoT platform. 


## Why IoT?

IoT has the following commercial and consumer applications [<a href='../bib.html#wikipedia-contributors-internet-of-things-wikipedia'>Ref.</a>]:

- Consumer applications
  - Smart home
  - Elder care
-	Organisational applications
    - Medical and healthcare
-	Transportation
    - Vehicle communications
    - Building and home automation
-	Industrial applications
    - Manufacturing
    - Agriculture
    - Infrastructure applications
- Metropolitan scale deployments
    - Energy management
    - Environmental monitoring



## Future of IoT

The commercial and industrial applications of IoT are now well
understood and different solutions are being developed. IoT device
adaption is expected to rise over the next couple of decades [<a
