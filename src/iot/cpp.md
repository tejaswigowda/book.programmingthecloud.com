# Arduino C++

The code in this section will be written in Arduino C++. Since this book
has introduced JS, it should be easy to transition into Arduino C++,
since both languages have borrowed syntax from C.

Please take a look at the <a
href='https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/'>Arduino C++ language
reference</a> for details. The code will be explained when first
introduced.
