# Touch Pad

The T Watch has a reliable input output using the touchpad module. We
have seen how to print to the touch screen in the `Hello World`
example. In this section we will get user input (touches) using the
touch pad.

# Serial Input/Output

For debugging purposes the Serial Port will be very useful. We have already
used the serial port to write to the T-watch's program memory (when we
loaded compiled binary of `helloWorld.ino`). In this section we will learn to
programmatically read and write to the Serial Port.
