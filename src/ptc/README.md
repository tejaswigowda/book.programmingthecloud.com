# Programming the Cloud

**Programming the Cloud (PtC)** is a reference for learning-by-example the
following:

1. Front end web technologies ([HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/),
   [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) and
[JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/)).
2. [Full-stack](https://skillcrush.com/2017/02/27/front-end-back-end-full-stack/) architecture design.
3. Implementing backend servers using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).
4. Administrating and programming [mongoDb](https://www.mongodb.com/)
   databases.
5. Building apps using [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/), [Capacitor](https://capacitor.ionicframework.com/) and [Electron](https://electronjs.org/).
6. Advanced JS concepts like the [event-model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_(computing)), [anonymous functions](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/JavaScript/Anonymous_functions), [callbacks](https://www.learn-js.org/en/Callbacks) etc.
7. Program internet/bluetooth enabled microcontrollers (focus on [esp32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp32/overview)).
8. Design/implement [Voice UI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_user_interface) for Amazon Echo, Google Nest etc.

PtC is free and open source, you can find the source code on
[GitHub](https://github.com/tejaswigowda/programmingthecloud).
 Issues and feature
requests can be posted on the [GitHub issue
tracker](https://github.com/tejaswigowda/programmingthecloud/issues).

## Organization

PtC is organized into 4 broad sections. 
- Section 1 teaches you the preliminary
concepts and basic skills.
- Section 2 discusses front end technologies
such as HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery, JSON.
- Section 3 completes our discussion
on full-stack programming by covering back-end technologies such as
servers, databases, managing IaaS, scaling etc.
- Section 4 covers how to write client and
server programs on microcontrollers thus enabling us to connect everyday
objetcs to the Internet (an emerging field called the Internet-of-Things
(IoT)).
