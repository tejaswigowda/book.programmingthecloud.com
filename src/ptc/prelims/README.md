# Preliminaries

In this section we will develop a concept map and vocabulary that will
serve as a foundation for our discussion throughout this book. We will
first discuss what the Client-Server Model is, then learn where in the
"Programmer's model" of a computer these client server programs reside.
We finally learn how these client-server programs communicate with each
other over the internet using URLs.

By the end of this section you should have a working definition and
concept map linking the following terms

- Client
- Server
- Computer
- Program
- Programmer's Model
- Port
- IP address
- URL
- Internet
- OSI Model
- HTTP
- HTTP request
- HTTP response
