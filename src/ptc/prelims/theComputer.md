# Programmer's Model of a Computer

We now know that clients and servers are programs that communicate with one another
according to the client-server model. But <i>where within the nodes of the Internet
(computers, phones, tablets) do clients and servers exist?</i>.

Clients and servers are <b>applications</b> that reside in the application
layer of a computer (see Figure above). For eg. YouTube.com is a server which can be
accessed via a web browser (on computers and phones) or apps (also on
computers and phone). Other examples include GitHub.com, Slack,
Facebook, Google etc. All these "Internet Software" have a server and
client apps as part of their ecosystem. Developing and maintaining these
is referred to as <b>devops</b> (Developer Operations).

This guide focusses on train you in devops for Internet Software
development.
Section 4 of the guide deals with deploying clients and servers on
Microcontrollers (small bare bones computers with no OS, but programmable
firmware).
