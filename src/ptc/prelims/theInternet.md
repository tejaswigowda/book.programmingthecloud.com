# The Internet

We all have a working definition of what
<i>Internet</i> means to us. However, just like there are different ways to
visualize a computer (as seen in last section), the Internet can
defined using different deinitions. These definitions are related by a
hierarchy called the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Model.
