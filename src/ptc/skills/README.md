# Basic Skills

This section covers the basic skills needed to follow along the code
examples in this book. If unfamiliar using the command line the section
on Bash will introduce you to the BASH shell. This shell is available on
all major operating systems -- Linux, Mac OS and Windows, via git-bash.
Once we have some familiarity with the command line, we will learn to
use GIT for managing our code. The chapter ends witha  discussion on
code editors and how to deploy code on remote machines.
