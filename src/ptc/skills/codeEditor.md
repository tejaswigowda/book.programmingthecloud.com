# Editing Code

The examples in this guide will need you to edit code/document format
files (HTML, CSS, JS, C++ etc.). You can use any editor you are
comfortable with. It is recommended that you use an editor with syntax
highlighting.

Here is a list of recommended code editors
- [Atom](https://atom.io/)
- [Brackets](http://brackets.io/)
- [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)
- [TextMate](https://macromates.com/)
- VI (use in bash)
- Emacs (use in bash)

The first 4 are visual editors with a 
simple to use, with a user-friendly GUI. VI and EMACS on the other hand
are command-line (Bash) editors. These will come in handy when you need
to edit on a remote machine. However both have steep learning curves and
will take practice to perfect. If you are new to programming this guide 
suggests you start with Atom Editor (first choice in the above list). It
has a tabbed editor and a project manager pane (Figure 2.5.1). You can easily add new
files, manage folders and edit/modify/save individual files.
